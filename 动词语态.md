# 动词语态

[TOC]



## 主动语态

**I give you a car**



## 被动语态

**You are given a car by me**



## 主动句和被动句

1、把主动句的宾语改成被动句的主语
2、把主动句的谓语动词改成，被动句谓语形式be+过去分词，并且人称和单复数要随着新主语变化，时态保持不变
3、把主动句的主语前面加by,放到谓语之后，变化人称宾格，如果看前面就知道是谁被谁做了什么，或者上下文有交代是谁，可以省略by加主语
4、其他句子成分保持不变

 

```
 My mother sweeps the floor every day morning.

The floor is swept by my mother everyday morning.
```



```
I bought some books.

Some books were bought (by me).
```
