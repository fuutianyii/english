​    Dragons are not real animals, but look like a combination (结合体) of many animals such as snakes, fish and deer.They have two horns (角) and a long moustache (胡子)．With fantastic power, they fly in the sky or swim in the sea.They can make rain, too.The Chinese dragon is a symbol of strength and good luck.The emperors of ancient China loved dra­gons.Their clothes were covered with pictures of dragons.

  We are proud to call ourselves the “descendants (传人) of the dragon”．In Chinese, “excellent” people are often called “dragons”．A number of Chinese sayings and idioms talk about dragons, for example, “Hoping_one's_child_will_become_a_dragon，” which means hoping he or she will be successful.

​    It is said that people born in the Year of the Dragon have certain characteristics.They are creative, confident, brave and quick­tempered.There are some famous “dragons” who have done excellent things, for example, the great man Deng Xiaoping, the famous businessman Li Jiacheng and the movie star Zhao Wei.They are all very successful.

  There are also some traditional festivals about dragons in China, such as Dragon Head­Raising Day and Dragon Boat Festival.We have different kinds of activities to celebrate them.These two festivals come every year, but the Year of the Dragon comes every twelve years.

  The dragon is very important in Chinese culture.As the “descendants of the dragon”， it is necessary for us to know the views on dragons in our culture.It can help us understand why our parents always want us to be “dragons”．

  This year is the Year of the Dragon.Good luck to you!

​    People are always afraid of making mistakes.But sometimes it's not bad to make mistakes, and here is why.

   At first, mistakes are a clear sign that you are trying new things.It's always good to try new things, because when you are trying new things you are growing.If you never try new things, how can you improve? How can you create? The simple answer is, “You can't.” Look around you, everything you see is the result of someone trying new things.

Another good thing about mistakes is this: when you are making mistakes, you are learning.Consider this: Edison failed 10,000 times before he invented the light bulb.When he was asked how he felt to fail that many times, he said that he hadn't failed 10,000 times, but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work.

   Finally, when you make a mistake, you are that much closer to success.Why? Because you have said what you should say, and you have done what you should do.Every time you make a mistake, you are closer to success.But it doesn't mean that you can make mistakes without thinking.Instead, when you try new things you have to think them over, so that you can keep away from some unnecessary mistakes.

   We shouldn't spend all our time and money on the only one way, but use them correctly.Because our time and money are limited (有限的)．

   There is an old saying, “If you are not making mistakes, you are not trying hard enough.” So go bravely and make mistakes.And learn.And grow.And succeed.

(　　)6.If you are making a mistake, that means________.

  A．you're careful          B．you're kind

 C．you're growing          D．you know nothing

(　　)7.If you never try new things, you can't________.

  A．improve   B．create      C．spend     D．A and B

(　　)8.After Edison failed 10,000 times, he________.

  A．gave up            B．invented the light bulb

 C．invented the computer       D．invented 10,000 new things

(　　)9.When you make a mistake, you are closer to________.

  A．time     B．money      C．success     D．everything

(　　)10.What's the main idea of the passage?

  A．Never make mistakes. B．You can make mistakes without thinking.

 C．Sometimes it's good to make mistakes. D．Making mistakes is terrible.

Swimming and English Learning

Can you swim? Do you like swimming? Yes? Well, how can you learn to swim? I think the best way is to learn to swim in the water.I'm afraid you'll never learn to swim just by reading books about swimming or looking at others swimming.It's the same with the English study for us kids today.We must practice, practice and practice.

Listening and speaking are important for school students.The children in English­speaking countries first listen to others.Then they try to imitate (模仿) and speak.We can listen to English programs on the radio.You may just understand a few words.It doesn't matter.Just be relaxed, try to get the main topics, then the main ideas, then the main sentences, then the key words, then the full meaning.As for speaking, speak as much as you can.

Reading and writing are more important for school students.First, we must choose the books that we're interested in.A lot of reading will improve your language sense (语感)．This is the most important.

Keep writing English diaries.You can also write English articles.You may even post them to English magazines.Don't be afraid of failure (失败)．Failure is the mother of success.

Easier said than done.Well, let's do more practice from now on.I'm sure you'll learn English well in this way.

​    On the afternoon of October 13th, 2011 in Foshan, a two­year­old baby girl was playing in the street while her pa­rents were busy working at their shop.But unfortunately, a truck went by and knocked into this poor girl.What's worse, without stopping to help the girl, the truck went over her, making this poor girl badly hurt.In the next 7 minutes, another truck went over her, and 18 passers­by just walked past without taking notice of the poor baby.At last, this girl was saved by an old woman who collected waste in the streets, but unluckily the baby girl was so badly hurt that she died at last.

​    This event aroused harsh criticism (引发强烈批判) on the Internet.But why do people seem so kind­hearted only on the Internet, but actually in the daily life we can hardly see them help each other? Lots of people made comments online: If you save someone who's hurt, he may say it's you who hurt him.You may have trouble when you do a good deed, because the law doesn't protect you.

​    We really need to learn from other countries in such cases.For example, in Singapore, if someone does wrong to the one who helps him, he has to say sorry in public and pay 3 times the medical fee as punishment.

​       Almost every child in cities has the chance to go to school, but not all children in the countryside are so lucky.

​       There is a girl called Xiao Juan.She is ten years old and lives in a small village.When she was seven, she wanted to go to school.But she could not, because her family was too poor to afford the school fees (学费) for her, so her parents had to keep her at home.Instead of studying, Xiao Juan looked after her brother and worked in the fields every day.Then Hope Project heard about Xiao Juan.It agreed to help Xiao Juan to go to school.Her wish of study came true, and now she is studying in a school.

​       Unluckily, there are many thousands of children who can not go to school.You can join in Hope Project and help these children.You know all the good work needs money.Hope Project needs your help.

​       If you give Hope Project ￥300 each year, it can pay for one child to go to school for a whole year.With more money, Hope Project can build new schools, buy good desks, chairs, blackboards and books.Let's help the children together and give them a chance to have a good start in life.

  请阅读下面这篇文章，根据所提供的信息，完成下面表格。

In the past, man did not have to think about the protection of his environment.There were not many people on the earth, and natural resources seemed to be unlimited (无限的) .

  Today, things are different.The world has become too crowded.We are using up our natural resources too quickly, and at the same time we are polluting our environment with dangerous chemicals.If we continue like this, human life on the earth will not survive (幸存)．

  Everyone realizes today that if too many fish are taken from the sea, there will soon be none left.Yet with modern fishing methods, more and more fish are caught.We know that if too many trees are cut down, forests will disappear and nothing will grow on the land.Yet, we continue to use bigger and more powerful machines to cut down more and more trees.

  We realize that if rivers are polluted with waste products from factories, we will die.However, in most countries waste products are still put into rivers or into the sea, and there are few laws to stop this.

  We know, too, that if the population of the world continues to rise at the present rate, in a few years, there will not be enough food.

  If we eat more vegetables and less meat, we will easily get more food.Land that is used to grow crops can feed five times more people than land where animals are kept.

  The world population will not rise so quickly if people use modern methods of birth control.

  Finally, if we educate people to think about the problems, we shall have a better and cleaner living place in the future.

“USA? Britain? Which country is better to study in？” We often hear such discussions.As China opens its door, it is a dream for many Chinese students to study abroad.They want to learn about the outside world.

  It's true that studying abroad can help students develop themselves.Their foreign language skills will be improved and it may be easier to find jobs.

  But there are problems that should be considered.Language is the first.Students must spend a lot of time learning another language.

  Students must also learn to live without parents' care and deal with all kinds of things they haven't done before, like looking after themselves.There are reports about Chinese students abroad running into an ocean of (许多) difficulties and giving up finally.When they have to take care of themselves, it is hard for students to study well.

  Finally, studying abroad brings a heavy burden to the family.For most Chinese parents, the cost of studying abroad is very high.But is it worth it?

We know that there are many famous people who have achieved success through their hard work in China.Liu Xiang is a good example.Once an American coach invited him there, but he refused.He kept training hard with his Chinese coach.He surprised the world when he won a gold medal at the Athens Olympic Games.So when you wonder which country is better to study in, think it again.
